Welcome to export-control.

The files in export-control are designed to assist with compliance with
https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/320-76-fr-1059
regarding serving files to embargoed countries.

There are 3 directories:
public -- contains the index.php
private -- contains the protected files
restricted -- contains the files with the IPs of restricted countries.

The public directory contains a file called "restricted.php" that is a comprehensive 
list of IP addresses that is generated by the bash script: createrestricted.sh

The index.php has some configurable options, such as contact name, email, and 
directory where the restricted files exist.

If you want to test the embargo, set:
$g_debug_restrict_me=1;

# simontool
simontool, a program to assist in the implementation of the simoncipher.

Where is simontool?  It is not here because of export control laws.  
simontool supports keys longer than 64-bit and therefore is subject to 1) export
control and 2) self reporting, even if the source code is available.  
For this reason, any code that can handle  encryption larger than 64-bits will be placed at: http://simon.ece.gatech.edu

Please see the document:
https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/320-76-fr-1059
to understand why this was done.

The PHP code used for export control is available in simontool/export-control.

If I get a definitive clear against prosecution from the Department of State, I will
move the simontool complete source here.

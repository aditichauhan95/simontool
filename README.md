# simontool

This repository primarily holds the public sources for simontool.

Simontool is a program that is intended to aid in the development of 
hardware implementations of the Simon cipher; however, it can also encrypt files.  The 
program is now fast due to the overhead of creating simulation data.  The program creates 
Piece-Wise-Linear wave forms that are of an appropriate format for SPICE simulators.  

The original simontool program, as documented is here: http://simon.ece.gatech.edu

for restrictions.

The current simontool program, including experimental features, is available in this 
repository.  The simontool/manual.txt describes how to use the tool, with odds and ends
